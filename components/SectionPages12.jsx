          <p className='SectionPage12box2p'>Formerly known as Madras , Chennai is the capital city of the state of Tamil Nadu , in the southern part of India . Located on the Coromandel coast of Bay of Bengal , Chennai is as dynamic as it is immersed in tradition . This ' capital of the south ' , is one among the four metropolitan siblings of India , having a rich cultural history which it perfectly balances with its metropolis lifestyle.</p>
          <p className='SectionPage12box2p'>A Amid its chaos of traffic and sweltering humid climate , Chennai is worth visiting for its temples steeped in south - Indian culture , British - era museums and monuments , culinary delights and Marina Beach ( Second largest urban beach in the world ) . Chennai's skyline is famous for its towering skyscrapers , but the heart of Chennai has an old - world charm to it that refuses to beÂ overshadowed</p>
